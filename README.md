# Approximate Algorithm for Employee Timetabling Problem (ETP) solution

This is an approximate algorithm, developed during the production of an article as part of the evaluation of the discipline Algorithms and Data Structures - PPCA/UnB.

The problem of the work schedule of socio-educational agents in an adolescent internment unit in the Federal District, Brazil, is reported, in order to adapt and optimize the weekly workload of 40 hours, with lower adjustments.

### Rules
- Socio-educational agents work on a 24h x 72h scale (24 hours of work x 72 hours of rest);
- At the end of the monthly cycle, the socio-educator must have completed and equivalent to 40 hours per week;
- Each module must have at least 2 agents per shift;
- At the end of the monthly cycle, the socio-educator must have completed and equivalent to 40 hours per week. Excessive or missing hours are controlled through workload adjustments in the following month;
- Legal leave of absence of civil servants should be considered, examples: vacations, allowances, medical certificates, etc. Absences are of the type: working hours adjustment (ACH), allowance (AB) and Vacation.

### Run
- config the raw_data.yaml
- go to main.py and execute
