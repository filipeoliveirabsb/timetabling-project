# the intervals between schedules are 3 days long
# optimal number of hours in month / employee=160h
# max hours in month / employee = 40h / week
# min employees / day in module = 2
# max employees / day in module = 4 (team lenght)

# The algorithm:
# 1) generate the scales with the heuristic algo-
#    rithm with the team arrangement (up to 18).
#    e.g:
#       scale1 => d1=t1, d2=t2, d3=t3, d4=t4
#       scale2 => d1=t2, d2=t4, d3=t3, d4=t1
#       ...
# 2) when generating the scale, the system must:
#    2.1) consider the absences of each team and
#       that there is one team 4 employees/ day
#    2.2) consider hours of workload adjustments
#
# 3) add up the hours of employees in the month
#    include in the column "total hours" in the
#    schedule_table
# 4) use a heuristic algorithm to find the best
#    scale, with setTime to measure the execution
#    time
